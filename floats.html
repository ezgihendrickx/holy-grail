			<h2><strong> <em>It's impossible to deny the serenity and simple beauty when confronted with a resolved minimalist interior.</em></strong></h2>
			<p>Clean lines, reductive, uncluttered, monochromatic, simplicity, "less is more"—these are some of the terms and concepts that immediately come to mind when thinking about minimalism. It's impossible to deny the serenity and simple beauty when confronted with a resolved minimalist interior, but achieving this look is more deliberate and frankly, difficult, than just choosing a few pieces of furniture for a white backdrop, which can leave a space feeling cold, sparse and unlived-in. Take a look at our guide below, crafted from conversations with three interior designers and two architects well-versed in designing simply stunning minimalist interiors; learn what the concept of minimalism is to them and how they have achieved form-focused interiors for their clients.What is Minimalism?</p>

			<p>“Minimalism for me is about keeping a space simple, uncluttered and accentuating the attractive architectural features of a space. The palette is mostly monochromatic and color is used as an accent,” says Sharon Blaustein, principal designer at B Interior LLC. "I think minimalism and functionality go hand in hand. A minimalist-designed space incorporates an open floor plan, lots of light, and simple line furnishings that are well-built and comfortable. All these create a soothing and inviting space that has a timeless aesthetic.</p>
			<h3>Challenges of Minimalist Design </h3>

			<p>"The biggest challenge is to make a space look warm and welcoming," says Blaustein. "When using a monochromatic color palette, atmosphere is created by combining different shades, tints and textures to create a dynamic atmosphere." This minimalist Manhattan pied-à-terre designed by Blaustein and her team contrasts greatly from the bustling city neighborhood in which it is located.</p>
